        <h1>Happy Birthday, My Beautiful Sofia! ❤️</h1>
        <div class="message">
            <p>I want to take you back to the year 2000 —<br>
            twenty-five years ago, the day the world became brighter because you were born.<br>
            That light shaped my soul long before I knew your name.</p>
            <p>Maybe the universe had already decided that one day, two souls would meet…<br>
            and everyone who sees them would say: “This is what true love looks like.”</p>
            <p>Yes, we met late.<br>
            Yes, we’ve only spent a short time together.<br>
            But love doesn’t count days or months —<br>
            because from the moment I met you, it felt like a miracle…<br>
            as if I had known you for years, for lifetimes, even before this life.<br>
            Like my heart had always been waiting for you.</p>
            <p>I am the happiest and luckiest man alive because I have you.<br>
            You are the most beautiful part of existence…<br>
            an angel from another world whose kindness brought meaning to my life and woke my soul again.</p>
            <p>My life, my world, my future, my girl…<br>
            I hope you stay by my side forever,<br>
            so I can give you the life you deserve —<br>
            because you deserve nothing less than the best.</p>
            <p>I miss you deeply.<br>
            I want to hold your hand again,<br>
            walk with you in the streets or by the sea,<br>
            kiss you like it’s our very first kiss all over again.</p>
            <p>I want every night, every day, every moment to be with you —<br>
            feeling your warmth, your touch, your presence.</p>
            <p>Maybe I’ve never said this clearly,<br>
            but I’m proud of myself when I see those beautiful eyes looking at me,<br>
            when I hear your sweet voice calling my name.</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday, the moon of my life.<br>
            Happy Birthday, my beautiful girl.<br>
            Happy Birthday, the best partner in the world.<br>
            Happy Birthday, my heart.<br>
            Happy Birthday, my world.<br>
            Happy Birthday, the reason I breathe.<br>
            Happy Birthday, my kind angel.<br>
            Happy Birthday, my heartbeat.<br>
            Happy Birthday… ❤️</p>
